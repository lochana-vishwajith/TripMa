**Main objective – **
Developing an online platform to manage tourists in Sri Lanka through pre-travel, travel, and post-travel phases in order to improve safety and enhance the tourist experience.

**Main Research questions - **
There are lot of applications that have forcused on different parts of travel planning, but there isnt any application which provides full fledged functionalities in the
pre travelling ,travelling and post travelling stages. In this application we have identified the potential enhancements that a digitalized application could do to enhance
the travelling experiance of a tourist.

**Individual research questions - **

There are several existing systems to find travel companions online. Most of the existing systems are considered about the destination and date range wish to travel
such as workaway.info, couchsurfing and the web application called JOIN MY TRIP consider the activities wish to do by the travelers and the destination. But when traveling
with a companion, communication among the members is important factor to enjoy the trip. But none of the system do not consider the languages can speak by both requested
traveler and the companion, when suggesting a companion. Apart from the language, budget range of the tour and age of the travelers plays a major role, when travelling 
with a stranger. If the budget of the suggested companions is higher than or lower than by considerable amount, satisfaction of the trip will be decreased. The main intend of
the suggested system is to overcome above problems by considering the age, language can speak and budget range of the tour, when suggesting a companion by the system.

The main Research problem to be solved in the suggested system is to avoiding safety and security vulnerabilities that could occur due to lack of local knowledge in travelling.
Also system will prepare the users to face challenging situation with a better knowledge through the safety precautions. Visualization of the identified threats is also a
challenging since the system should not impact the tourists experience by scaring them with dangerous warnings for small threats but also need to inform them about the dangerous
threats in a convincing manner as well. Most of the research projects that have analyzing this issue faced a similar kind of problem which is lack of dataset availability in 
the Sri Lankan context. So for this intended problem as well as a solution to add more accuracy for the system we are enabling users to add real-time problem reporting
functionality which will notify the other users who have saved the intended destinations along with routes and those problems along with geo location will be saved in DB.

As Sri Lanka has been ranked number four as the world's top Wellness Tourism Destination confirmed that Sri Lanka is the main tourist destination. With the current situation 
of the world more tourists like to engage with less crowd. Also, less crowd will improve the tourists’ travel experience. In Sri Lankan context there are some tour planning
and recommendation systems but none of them have an accurate way to predict best time visit tourist attractions. Having proper idea whether the travelers’ preferred attraction 
spots is busy, crowd, the weather condition and the place is open before visiting the spot will improve the travel experience.

One of the main problems that business owner has is to identify the needs and the expectations of the customers. In this scenario, the admin of the system must understand
the needs of the travels to offer them a better service with the online platform. There are many ways to understand the customer's needs, but one of the most effective ways
is to analyze their feedback. When it comes to travel planning-related online platforms the online consumers are looking for the data of the previous users before consuming 
a service. There are a lot of sources for data regarding the different types of online service providers. But the accuracy of those data is questionable. The feedback section
of an online platform is one of the most visited sections in the system, especially when it comes to new consumers. There are different types of people who consume a service
from the platform. The reputation and the expertise of the consumer make the quality and the readability of the feedback. 

**Individual Objectives - **

The main objective of the proposed software solution is to suggest a best travel companion or a group of companions by identifying the requested user’s age category and
travel destination that is selected at the trip planning stage of the system.  
With the help of data that collected from the registration form in the system and saved in DB, system will identify the age category that the user belongs. According to
the identified age category, system will check the most considerable factor for that age category among the budget, age of the companion and languages that can speak.
By considering most weighted factor and other factors respectively for that identified age rage, system will suggest a best travel companion or group of companions.

Implementation of a system which recognized the possible hazards that user may confront while travelling and recommend them alternative safe routes to travel and provided
the safety precautions. In this system when user entered the travel destinations that user want to visit with date and the travel medium, then the system identifies the 
possible routes that user could choose by calculating the indexes of safety security and the comfortability, and then system predict the safest route that could use alongside 
safety precautions for the safety vulnerabilities that might occur.

The main objective of the proposed software solution is to Recommend a tourist attraction places according to tourists’ preferences and best time to visit the spots with the
help of collected dataset, weather API, social media analyzing for avoid crowd and real time user updates system will identify the best time to visit the attraction spots. 

IT19152806 - 
The main objective of this research is to develop an automated system to analyze the tourist feedback to understand their needs to provide a better service for future travelers.
From this system, we analyze the traveler’s feedback and display the most accurate positive feedback in the system feedback section, so that new travelers can find more
accurate data regarding the online platform as well as the travel experience in Sri Lanka. From this automated system, the admin of the online platform can view the negative
feedback which is given by the travelers. So the admin can work on improving the system to increase the travelers' quality of the traveling experience in Sri Lanka. From this
system, the admin can find out the issues that people face when they are traveling in Sri Lanka and report those issues to the tourism board.
